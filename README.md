## Greetings! :wave::wave:

My name is Matheus Dias and I'm a (almost) self-taught software developer.

Although I have a Psychology degree, since 2020 I've been studying software development through a javascript technology stack. So far I've focused especially on front-end development, but I have some back-end knowledge and I still intend to deepen it further.

By the way, I consider myself _almost_ self-taught because in august 2021 I started a course on Web Development at <a href="https://www.digitalhouse.com/br/acoes/certified-tech-developer">Digital House</a> and successfully completed its first year.

### Most relevant projects :file_folder:

These are not relevant due to the impact they had on some business or on society at large, but due to the level of learning that I had while developing them. I listed them from newest to oldest.

### <img width="50%" src="./assets/logo-dark.svg" alt="Logo da DAMA">

DAMA is an amazing product by [Audo](https://www.audo.com.br/), and I got hired to develop it's marketing website.

It's a simple landing page, but this was my first freelance project, so I learned so much coding under third party deadlines, with third party design and towards a goal not set by me.

I still had the freedom to choose the technologies I wished, as long as the final product would be a statically served folder, so I found a way to use TSX in this project.

And although the latest version hasn't been deployed yet, [here's the link to the functional app.](http://damacad.com.br/)

#### <img src="./assets/letmeask.svg">

Letmeask is a front-end studying app that I made by following a tutorial and then making improvements of my own. Because of this I won a scholarship to a <a href="https://rocketseat.com.br/ignite">Rocketseat's</a> paid course.

This one is a much more properly documented project, so I only need to mention it here and you may know more about it better by reading it's `README.md`.

<a href="https://github.com/Matheus-Days/letmeask">Here's the link to the repo.</a>

<a href="https://letmeask-bc5d7.web.app/">Here's the link to the functional app.</a>

#### Psyte:

<img src="./assets/psyte_demo.gif">

My first complete application. I used the React library and Material UI components for the front-end.

For the back-end I created a NODE server. The most difficult part was configuring a server-side Webpack script so that I could serve a pre-rendered page so web crawlers could index my website properly.

Also I had little to no idea on how to use Git/Github, not to mention on how to maintain a nice folder structure so Psyte's repo is a mess to be honest.
