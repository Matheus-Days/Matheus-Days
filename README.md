### Greetings! :wave::wave:

_[VersÃ£o em pt-br abaixo.]_

My name is Matheus Dias and I'm a (almost) self-taught software developer student.

Although I have a Psychology degree, since 2020 I've been studying software development through a javacript technology stack. So far I've focused specially at frontend apps, but I have some backend knowledge and I still intend to deepen it further.

By the way, I said that I'm _almost_ self-taught because in august 2021 I started a 2 years course on Web Development at <a href="https://www.digitalhouse.com/br/acoes/certified-tech-developer">Digital House</a>.

#### Technologies :computer:

That I have some mastery:

- HTML `<h1></h1>`
- CSS `.whitetext { color: #FFF }`
- Javascript `console.log("Hello World");`
- ReactJs `<MyComponent myProp={myState} />`

That I can use:

- NODEJs <img src="./assets/nodejs.svg" width="30px">
- Typescript
- C#

Here are some ideas to get you started:
