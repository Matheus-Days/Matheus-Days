## Greetings! :wave::wave:

My name is Matheus Dias and I'm a (almost) self-taught software development student.

Although I have a Psychology degree, since 2020 I've been studying software development through a javascript technology stack. So far I've focused especially on frontend apps, but I have some backend knowledge and I still intend to deepen it further.

By the way, I said that I'm _almost_ self-taught because in august 2021 I started a 2 years course on Web Development at <a href="https://www.digitalhouse.com/br/acoes/certified-tech-developer">Digital House</a>.

### Technologies :computer:

That I have some mastery:

- HTML5 <img src="./assets/html5.svg" alt="html5" height="25"/>
- CSS <img src="./assets/css3.svg" alt="css3" height="25"/>
- Javascript <img src="./assets/javascript.svg" alt="javascript" height="25"/>
- ReactJs <img src="./assets/react.svg" alt="reactjs" height="25"/>

That I can use the basic features:

- NextJs <img src="./assets/nextjs.svg" alt="nextjs" height="25"/>
- NODEJs <img src="./assets/nodejs.svg" alt="nodejs" height="25"/>
- Typescript <img src="./assets/typescript.svg" alt="typescript" height="25"/>
- C# <img src="./assets/csharp.svg" alt="drawing" height="25"/>

That I'm looking forward to learn:

- React Native <img src="./assets/react.svg" alt="react native" height="25"/>
- .NET <img src="./assets/dotnet.svg" alt="dot net" height="25"/>
- Java <img src="./assets/java.svg" alt="java" height="25"/>
- Kotlin <img src="./assets/kotlin.svg" alt="kotlin" height="25"/>

### Most relevant projects :file_folder:

These are not relevant due to the impact they had on some business or on society at large, but due to the level of learning that I had while developing them. I listed them from oldest to newest.

#### Psyte:

<img src="./assets/psyte_demo.gif">

My first complete application. I used the React library and Material UI components for the front-end.

For the back-end I created a NODE server. The most difficult part was configuring a server-side Webpack script so that I could serve a pre-rendered page so web crawlers could index my website properly.

Also I had little to no idea on how to use Git/Github, not to mention on how to maintain a nice folder structure so Psyte's repo is a mess to be honest.

<a href="https://github.com/Matheus-Days/psyte-app">Here's the link to it.</a>

[The app itself is currently offline, but there're videos of it in my Linkedin profile <a href="/Matheus-Days#How-to-reach-me-mailbox_with_mail">below</a>.]

#### <img src="./assets/letmeask.svg">

Letmeask is a front-end studying app that I made by following a tutorial and then making improvements of my own. Because of this I won a scholarship to a <a href="https://rocketseat.com.br/ignite">Rocketseat's</a> paid course.

This one is a much more properly documented project, so I only need to mention it here and you may know more about it better by reading it's `README.md`.

<a href="https://github.com/Matheus-Days/letmeask">Here's the link to the repo.</a>

<a href="https://letmeask-bc5d7.web.app/">Here's the link to the functional app.</a>
