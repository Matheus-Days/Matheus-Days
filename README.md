## Greetings! :wave::wave:

My name is Matheus Dias and I'm a (almost) self-taught software developer.

Although I have a Psychology degree, since 2020 I've been studying software development through a javascript technology stack. So far I've focused especially on front-end development, but I have some back-end knowledge and I still intend to deepen it further.

By the way, I consider myself _almost_ self-taught because in august 2021 I started a course on Web Development at <a href="https://www.digitalhouse.com/br/acoes/certified-tech-developer">Digital House</a>, successfully completing its first year, and now I'm undergoing a Software Engineer undergraduated degree since the begining of 2024.

### <img width="50%" src="./assets/practicus-logo.svg" alt="Logo da Practicus">

In collaboration with [Carina](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carina-torquato-174467229/) who made the UI design, I developed the landing page for the Practicus company. It focus in promoting their products, events and company public information. It also has a blog feature that will be enabled as soon as the article author starts posting.

For a better SEO (search engine optimization), I chose to develop the app with NextJs, relying on its SSR and SSG features for gaining a greater LightHouse metrics evaluation, not to menting to be able to be properly indexed by the search engine crawlers.

Also, the client asked for a website that they could update the content with some frequency, I opted for using a CMS (content management system), specifically Prismic, which has great prices for low traffic projects like this one.

For styling, I mainly used TailwindCSS, but I also picked some components from MUI and custom styled them.

### <img src="./assets/eduardo-autos-logo.jpg" alt="Logo da oficina mecÃ¢nica Eduardo Autos">

One of my Software Engenier disciplines is a recurrent extension project, which every semester requires me to take part in some project for and with my local community. On my first semester, I chose to help a local business to improve their online presence by creating a landing page.

The client is an automotive workshop and for the the design I got help from one of the owners sister who works with UX design. Together we gathered the requirements with the owner and then I began development.

The project didn't require any complicated features, but needed to be blazing fast and to be 'crawlable' for SEO, so I chose to use only vanilla HTML5, CSS3 and JS. For bundling, I used Vite, since it would not be optimal to serve non-minified files, and my development workflow would be hindered by being able to use only native `import` syntax.

After delivery, the client decided to wait before choosing a custom domain, so we left the URL provided by Netlify (where we hosted the landing page) untouched.

### <img width="50%" src="./assets/logo-dark.svg" alt="Logo da DAMA">

DAMA is an amazing product by [Audo](https://www.audo.com.br/), and I got hired to develop it's marketing website.

It's a simple landing page, but this was my first freelance project, so I learned so much coding under third party deadlines, with third party design and towards a goal not set by me.

I still had the freedom to choose the technologies I wished, as long as the final product would be a statically served folder, so I found a way to use TSX in this project.
